# Pre-Made Pathways

The five pre-made pathways are stored in `pathways` as dictionaries. Icons for each pathway come from the Noun Project or are standard language icons.

To update the contents or description of a pathway, change the appropriate data in the pathway's dictionary.

To add a new pathway, create a dictionary for it and then add the name of the dictionary to  `pathway_list` at the end of `pathways.py`.
