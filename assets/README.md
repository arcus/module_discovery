# Assets

This is where all of the metadata about educational resources is stored. 

## education_modules 
- `education_modules.json` contains the metadata from the [education_modules repository](https://github.com/arcus/education_modules). 
    - This file is automatically updated once a week via the ["Update metadata from education_modules repository" action](https://github.com/arcus/module_discovery/actions/workflows/update_module_data.yml)
    - If this needs to be updated immediately, there is a workflow_dispatch event trigger to run it manually.

## Pre-Made Pathways
There are 5 pre-made pathways that users can select and then modify to meet their needs.

## Other assets

Other assets will be added as they are gathered (or created in the case of Arcus educational resources that do not belong in the education_modules repo) and cataloged.
