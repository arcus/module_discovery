This component contains the list of a user's modules. The internal callbacks allowing a user to re-order the modules in that list are also here.

The `pathway_buttons.py` file contains functions for rendering the row of each module within the pathway, depending on how "well-ordered" it is within the pathway and large body of knowledge.
