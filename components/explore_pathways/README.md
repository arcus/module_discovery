The Explore Pathways tab renders the pathways stored in `/assets/pre_made_pathways`. Any changes to how the pathways are rendered should be made here. **Any modifications to the content or descriptions of pathways themselves should be made in the `assets` directory.**

The body of this page and the main card of each pathway is built by `pre_made_pathways`:
