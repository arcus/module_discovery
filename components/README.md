# components

Elements of our visual layout form our components.

Add a screenshot here or wireframe with the name of your components.  Consider what your layout looks like on computer screens and any responsiveness you have (responsive meaning it changes its layout based on screen real estate, e.g. phone vs tablet vs desktop).  You might have several wireframes. I can help with photoshop if you don't have a license.

* `app_title` is located at the top of the screen.  Its function is to identify the application and provide branding...

* similarly document each component and its function.  What is it doing for the user (not just where is it in space)?
