# Stylesheets

Stylesheets for the cytoscape visualizations live here.
See the [Dash Cytoscape style documentation](https://dash.plotly.com/cytoscape/styling) or the more extensive (but possibly not fully implemented in Dash) [Cytoscape.js style documentation](https://js.cytoscape.org/#style).


Possible scheme for how different nodes are differentiated:

## Active node - Size

The active node is distinguished visually by being bigger than the other nodes around it. 

## Pathway - Shape

Modules on a user's pathway are distinguished visually by being star-shaped, instead of circular nodes.

Edges denoting the pathway's route through the modules are thicker than other edges.

## Search Results

Modules that match the user's search results are distinguished by color.
