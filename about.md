# About the Module Discovery Tool Prototype

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the [Module Discovery Tool Prototype](learn.arcus.chop.edu). This page will tell you about about the history of the project, its short and long term goals, and how you can help.

If you are looking for a guide to the prototype's code and instructions on how to run it locally or even create your own version, please check out [this repository's README](https://github.com/arcus/module_discovery?tab=readme-ov-file#module-discovery-app).

## What is the Module Discovery Tool?

The purpose of this tool is to allow users to explore free, open-source, module education aimed at teaching biomedical researcher the tools of data science. Users can use the tool in its current (prototype) version to learn more about the different modular offerings, search for materials that meet their needs, and build a pathway of modules that will best serve their needs or select one of our pre-built pathways.

Ultimately, the goal of this tool is to be a pathway recommender, in addition to a platform for discovering educational materials. 

## Why is the Module Discovery Tool?

We created over 60 short, asynchronous learning modules as part of the [Data and Analytics Research Training Program (DART)](https://arcus.github.io/education_modules/). The idea of this program was to give people tailored, modular education that meets their need to upskill quickly in data science without the extra bload of longer courses that teach things they might already know or not need for their jobs.

But creating tailored pathways through the complex network of these educational modules is a lot of work, and displaying our [catalogue as a list](https://arcus.github.io/education_modules/list_of_modules) is not a particularly efficient way for people seeking knowledge to find it. This tool was created to help connect people who want to learn to modules and pathways that are a good fit for them.

## Who is behind the Module Discovery Tool?

The DART program was created by the Arcus Education team, a 5 person group within the Arcus project at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) with funding from National Institutes of Health award number 5R25GM141501. 

While the Module Discovery Tool is an offshoot of that work, it is primarily the work of one team member, [Elizabeth Drellich](https://github.com/drelliche). 


Significant additional help with this project has come from other members of the Arcus project at CHOP.
